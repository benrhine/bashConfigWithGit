# bashConfigWithGit
Customized bash profile with automatic git branch names when in a git directory

This cusomized git file was borrowed from another friendly git repository which I have since forgot so if it was yours thank you for the starting point.

I have added a function that allows you to quickly switch between different JVM's on the command line for faster testing of different versions of Java while programming. I have also incorporated the .git-prompt.sh. This script will display what git branch you are on when you are in a git enabled directory.
  ex. user@computer ~/Respository/bashConfigWithGit (master)
I chose to add this as I was always checking which branch I was on and this makes it so its automatically done for you. I hope this helps some people improve their configs.

Found the original repo which can be found here https://gist.github.com/natelandau/10654137
